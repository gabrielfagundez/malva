					<h2>About Malva</h2>
				</header>
				<p>
                    Malva is an unofficial fork of the Malva project. <br/>
                    It is an effort to develop, in an integrated way, a library of skeletons for combinatorial optimization <br/>
                    (including exact, heuristic and hybrid methods) that can deal with parallelism in a user-friendly and, <br/>
                    at the same time, efficient manner.
                    <br/>
                    Its three target environments are sequential computers, LANs of workstations and WANs.
				</p>
                <br>

                <h3>The main features of Malva are:</h3>

                <li>Integration of all the skeletons under the same design principles.</li>
                <li>Facility to switch from sequential to parallel optimization engines. By providing sequential implementations users obtain parallel implementations.</li>
                <li>Cooperation between engines makes possible to provide more powerful hybrid engines.</li>
                <li>Ready to use on commodity machines.</li>
                <li>Flexible and extensible software architecture. New skeletons can easily be added, alternative communication layers can be used, etc.</li>

                    <div class="full-explanation">
                        Malva skeletons are based on the separation of two concepts: the concrete problem to be solved and
                        the general resolution method to be used. They can be seen as generic templates that just need
                        to be instantiated with the features of a problem in order to solve it. All features related to
                        the selected generic resolution method and its interaction with the concrete problem are
                        implemented by the skeleton. While the particular features related to the problem must be given
                        by the user, the knowledge to parallelize the execution of the resolution method is implemented
                        in the skeleton, so that users do not need to deal with parallelism issues.

                        <br />
                        <br />
                        The design of the Malva library focuses on easy to use skeletons and general and efficient
                        implementations. To achieve both objectives, the C++ programming language was selected due to
                        its high level, modularity, flexibility and efficiency features. We have reduced to a minimum
                        the use of inheritance and virtual methods in order to provide better efficiency and ease of use.
                        To instantiate most problems, a basic knowledge of C++ is enough, and only sequential code
                        without side effects is needed.

                        <br />
                        <br />
                        Skeletons are implemented by a set of required and provided C++ classes that represent an
                        abstraction of the entities participating in the resolution method. The provided classes
                        implement internal aspects of the skeleton in a problem-independent way. The required classes
                        specify information and behavior related to the problem. This conceptual separation allows us
                        to define required classes with a fixed interface but without any implementation, so that provided
                        classes can use required classes in a generic way.

                        <br />
                        <br />
                        More specifically, each skeleton includes the Problem and Solution required classes, that
                        encapsulate the problem-dependent entities needed by the resolution method. The Problem class
                        abstracts the features of the problem that are relevant to the selected optimization method.
                        The Solution class abstracts the features of the feasible solutions that are relevant to the
                        selected resolution method. Depending on the skeleton, other classes may be required. On the
                        other hand, each skeleton offers two provided classes: Solver and SetUpParams. The former abstracts
                        the selected resolution method. The later contains the setup parameters needed to perform the
                        execution (e.g. number of iterations, number of independent runs, parameters guiding the search,
                        etc.). The Solver class provides methods to run the resolution scheme and methods to consult
                        its progress or change its state. The only information the solver needs is an instance of the
                        problem to solve and the setup parameters. In order to enable an skeleton to have different
                        solver engines, the Solver class defines a unique interface and provides several subclasses
                        that provide different sequential and parallel implementations (Solver_Seq, Solver_Lan and Solver_Wan).
